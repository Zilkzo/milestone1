We've managed to complete our project on ASP.NET.
Our project is the Star Wars store, in which customers may purchase any merch with their favourite character or image from this universe.
We have several pages showing favorite merch, all merch and pages particularized for a certain category's merch. 
Our authorization is based on roles, however, only admin may login/logout to make changes on a website. 
To purchase anything customers just need to add to cart any of the merch they like. And in the Cart they have possibility to pay for the products only by fulfilling fields with the personal information. No registration is needed.
While admin may add any merch or delete them.
