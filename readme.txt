Until this time we've managed to finish the first step to complete our project on ASP.NET.
Our project is the Star Wars store, in which customers may purchase any merch with their favourite character or image from this universe.
For now, we have 3 pages: Home, where customers may see all favorite merch, All merch page, where we have listed all merch from our store, and Cart, which shows you list of merch that you've added to your cart and possibility to pay for all of products.
